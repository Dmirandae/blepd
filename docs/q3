Roughly speaking from 1000 -- 10000 the results are alike, and the 
largest difference is in 10 --100. As a rule of thumb, we most use at 
least 100 replicates, but 1000 will be better.



now, let's see if the possible difference in results could be assigned to both of our longest branches.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}


## Testing the effect if we reduce the branch lenght form the actual value to 0.0 using evalTerminal {lower}
