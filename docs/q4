The area selected depends heavily in the branch length of _R._ _aerolata_ and _R._ _rubida_, if the branch length is just a little shorter, the area selected will change from area A to area B.


To test whether internal branches have more impact than terminal branches, we can use the function evalTerminalvsInternal.


```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
