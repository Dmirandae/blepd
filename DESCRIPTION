Author: Daniel Rafael Miranda-Esquivel

Description: These functions evaluate:  1. Whether a change in one or more terminal branch length(s) generates a change in the area selected using PD, and when applies, the terminal branch length value for that change.   2. The behavior of PD to some null models (swapping terminal branch lengths or replacing them with a known distribution).
