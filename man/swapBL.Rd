\usage{
swapBL(
  tree = tree,
  distribution = distribution,
  model = "allswap",
  nTimes = 100,
  root = TRUE,
  index = "PD",
  branch = "terminals",
  percentual = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A single phylogenetic tree with terminal labels, an `ape` phylo object.}

\item{distribution}{A labeled matrix object, with the distribution of terminal taxa (columns) across areas (rows).}

\item{model}{The type of swap to be performed. Valid values are:}

\item{nTimes}{The number of times to repeat the swap.}

\item{root}{Whether to use the root node in PD calculations (default = FALSE).}

\item{branch}{The type of branches to swap: "terminals" (default), "internals", or "all".}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print messages during execution (default = TRUE).}
}
\value{
Returns a `blepd` object containing:
  * `initialPD`: The PD value of the initial tree.
  * `bestInitialArea`: The area(s) with the highest PD value in the initial tree.
  * `bestModifiedArea`: A data frame summarizing the frequency of each area recovered after swaps.
  * `tree`: The original tree object.
  * `distribution`: The distribution matrix used for PD calculations.
  * `model`: The type of swap performed ("simpleswap", "allswap", or "uniform").
  * `nTimes`: The number of times the swap was repeated.
  * `root`: Whether the root was used in PD calculations.
  * `index`: The PD index used (currently always "PD").
  * `branch`: The type of branches swapped ("terminals", "internals", or "all").
}
\description{
The function calculates the effect on PD of swapping terminal or internal branch lengths.
