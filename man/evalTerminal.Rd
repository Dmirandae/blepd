\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree object (e.g., from the `ape` package).}

\item{distribution}{A labeled matrix object representing the distribution of}

\item{root}{A logical value indicating whether to use the root edge in the swapping #' process (default: TRUE).}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print progress information  during the execution (default: TRUE).}

\item{model}{The type of edge swapping to perform:
* "simpleswap": Swaps the lengths of two randomly selected edges.
* "allswap": Swaps the lengths of all possible edge pairs (computationally 
* "uniform": Randomly assigns new edge lengths from a uniform distribution}

\item{nTimes}{The number of repetitions to perform for the chosen swapping model.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
  * initialPD: The initial value of the chosen index (e.g., PD) calculated for the original tree.
  * bestInitialArea: The area with the highest value in the initial PD calculation.
  * bestModifiedArea: A data frame summarizing the results of each repetition, including the modified PD, selected area, and delta (percentage change) compared to the initial area.
  * tree: The original tree object.
  * distribution: The original distribution matrix.
  * model: The model used for edge swapping.
  * nTimes: The number of repetitions performed.
  * root: The logical value indicating whether the root edge was included in swapping.
  * index: The index used for evaluation (e.g., "PD").
}
\description{
This function swaps the lengths of two edges in a phylogenetic tree and evaluates the resulting change in the selected area based on a specific index (e.g., PD). It performs multiple repetitions (nTimes) to assess the potential impact of edge length swapping on the chosen index.

\examples{
library(blepd)  # Assuming blepd provides PDindex function
data(tree)
data(distribution)

# Run swapBL with different models
result1 <- swapBL(tree, distribution, model = "simpleswap", nTimes = 10)
result2 <- swapBL(tree, distribution, model = "allswap", nTimes = 10)
result3 <- swapBL(tree, distribution, model = "uniform", nTimes = 10)

# Print information from the results
print(result1)
print(result2)
print(result3)
