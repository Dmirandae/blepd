These functions evaluate 

1. Whether a change in a/some branch length(s) generate(s) a change in the area(s) selected using PD; 
and when applies, the terminal branch length value for that change.

2. The behavior of PD when the terminal / internal branch lengths are swapped _via_ a null model.

A worked example (_Rhinnoclemmys_) could be found in  [https://github.com/Dmirandae/blepd/blob/primary/docs/RhinnoclemmysExample.pdf]

The algorithm's description could be found in [https://github.com/Dmirandae/blepd/blob/master/docs/blepdAlgorithm.pdf].
