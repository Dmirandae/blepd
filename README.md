These functions evaluate 

1. whether a change in a/some terminal branches' length generates a change in the area(s) selected using PD; 
and when applies, the terminal branch length value for that change.  

2. the behaviour of PD when the terminal branch lengths area swapped _via_ a null model.

A worked example could be found in  [https://github.com/Dmirandae/blepd/blob/master/docs/workedExample.pdf].

The algorithm's description could be found in [https://github.com/Dmirandae/blepd/blob/master/docs/blepdAlgorithm.pdf].
