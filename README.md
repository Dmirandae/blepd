These functions evaluate:

1. Whether a change in one or more branch lengths generates a change in the area(s) selected using PD; and when applicable, the terminal branch length value for that change.
2. The behavior of PD when terminal or internal branch lengths are swapped using a null model.

A worked example (using _Rhinnoclemmys_) can be found at [https://github.com/Dmirandae/blepd/blob/primary/docs/RhinnoclemmysExample.pdf].

The algorithm's description can be found at [https://github.com/Dmirandae/blepd/blob/master/docs/blepdAlgorithm.Rmd].
